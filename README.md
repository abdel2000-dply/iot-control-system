# IoT Device Control and Data Management API

This project aims to simplify managing your IoT devices.
For example controlling lights, thermostats, or sensors through one central hub. This API will allow users to register their devices, send control commands, collect sensor data, and even receive real-time updates .

## Features

- **Device Registration:** Users can register their IoT devices with the API, providing a seamless way to manage multiple devices.
- **Control Commands:** Send commands to devices to perform actions like turning on/off lights, adjusting thermostat settings, etc.
- **Data Collection:** Collect and store data from sensors and devices, enabling users to analyze their device's performance and environment.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Receive updates from devices in real-time, allowing for immediate response to changes in device status or environmental conditions.
- **User Management:** Manage user accounts and permissions, ensuring secure access to device controls and data.
